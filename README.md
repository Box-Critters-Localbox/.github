This organization focuses on archiving and perserving Box Critters, a defunct virtual world made by Rocketsnail Games.

> **This organization is in no way affiliated with Rocketsnail Games or Box Critters as a whole.**

## Projects

- [Localbox](https://github.com/Box-Critters-Localbox/Localbox): a Typescript remake of the official Box Critters game server, built using Deno.
- [Docs](https://github.com/Box-Critters-Localbox/Docs): documentation surrounding the internals of how the Box Critters game client works, such as its network packets. [(deployed version)](https://localbox.gitbook.io/docs)
- [Desktop](https://github.com/Box-Critters-Localbox/Desktop): for ease-of-use, a simple Electron app that runs Localbox under the hood, allowing the user to not have to deal with any technical stuff, with added Discord RPC suppport.
